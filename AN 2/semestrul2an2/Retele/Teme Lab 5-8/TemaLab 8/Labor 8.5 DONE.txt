Part 1

Step 1)
How many host addresses are available in a /25 network?
Raspuns: 126
What is the total number of host addresses needed in the topology diagram?
Raspuns: 80
How many subnets are needed in the network topology?
Raspuns: 6

Step 2)
What is the subnet description (e.g. BR1 LAN or BR1-BR2 link)?
Raspuns: BR1 LAN
How many IP addresses are required in the largest subnet?
Raspuns: 40
What subnet mask can support that many host addresses?
Raspuns: /26 -> 255.255.255.192
How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support?
Raspuns: 62
Can you subnet the 192.168.33.128/25 network address to support this subnet?
Raspuns: Da, se poate
What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting?
Raspuns: 192.168.33.128/26 si 192.168.33.192/26

Step 3)
What is the subnet description?
Raspuns: BR2 LAN
How many IP addresses are required for the second largest subnet?
Raspuns: 25
What subnet mask can support that many host addresses?
Raspuns: /27 -> 255.255.255.224
How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support?
Raspuns: 30
Can you subnet the remaining subnet again and still support this subnet?
Raspuns: Da, se poate
What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting?
Raspuns: 192.168.33.192/27 si 192.168.33.224/27

Step 4)
What is the subnet description?
Raspuns: BR2 IoT LAN
How many IP addresses are required for the next largest subnet?
Raspuns: 5
What subnet mask can support that many host addresses?
Raspuns: /29 -> 255.255.255.248
How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support?
Raspuns: 6
Can you subnet the remaining subnet again and still support this subnet?
Raspuns: Da, se poate
What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting?
Raspuns: 192.168.33.224/29, 192.168.33.232/29, 192.168.33.240/29 si 192.168.33.248/29

Step 5)
What is the subnet description?
Raspuns: BR1-BR2 Link
How many IP addresses are required for the next largest subnet?
Raspuns: 2
What subnet mask can support that many host addresses?
Raspuns: /30 -> 255.255.255.252
How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support?
Raspuns: 4
Can you subnet the remaining subnet again and still support this subnet?
Raspuns: Da, se poate
What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting?
Raspuns: 192.168.33.248/30 sau 192.168.33.252/30
