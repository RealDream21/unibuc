Part 1:
Step 1. d)
How many host addresses are needed in the largest required subnet?
Raspuns: 50

What is the minimum number of subnets required?
Raspuns: 4

The network that you are tasked to subnet is 192.168.0.0/24. What is the /24 subnet mask in binary?
Raspuns: 1111.1111/1111.1111/1111.1111/0000.0000

Step 1. e)
In the network mask, what do the ones represent?
Raspuns: Network portion, biti blocati

In the network mask, what do the zeros represent?
Raspuns: Host portion, biti liberi

Step 1. f)
1)(/25) 11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000

Dotted decimal subnet mask equivalent:
255.255.255.128

Number of subnets? Number of hosts?
2^1 -> 2 subneturi
2^7 - 2 = 128 - 2 = 126 hosts

2)(/26) 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000

Dotted decimal subnet mask equivalent:
255.255.255.192

Number of subnets? Number of hosts?
2^2 = 4 subnets
2^6 - 2 = 62 hosts

3)(/27) 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000

Dotted decimal subnet mask equivalent:
255.255.255.224

Number of subnets? Number of hosts?
2^3 = 8 subnets
2^5 - 2 = 30 hosts

4)(/28) 11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000

Dotted decimal subnet mask equivalent:
255.255.255.240

Number of subnets? Number of hosts?
2^4 = 16 subnets
2^4 - 2 = 14 hosts

5)(/29) 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000

Dotted decimal subnet mask equivalent:
255.255.255.248

Number of subnets? Number of hosts?
2^5 = 32 subnets
2^3 - 2 = 6 hosts

6)(/30) 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100

Dotted decimal subnet mask equivalent:
255.255.255.252

Number of subnets? Number of hosts?
2^6 = 64 subnets
2^2 - 2 = 2 hosts

Considering your answers above, which subnet masks meet the required number of minimum host addresses?
Raspuns: /26, /25

Considering your answers above, which subnet masks meets the minimum number of subnets required?
Raspuns: /26, /27, /28, /29, /30

Considering your answers above, which subnet mask meets both the required minimum number of hosts and the minimum number of subnets required?
Raspuns: /26
