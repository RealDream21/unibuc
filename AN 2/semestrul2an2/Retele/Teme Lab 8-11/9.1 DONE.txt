Raspuns: protocoale diferite

Part 2:

Step 1. d)
Why did it take so long for the HTTP PDU to appear?
Raspuns: prima data trebuia facuta conexiunea cu serverul prin TCP

Step 1.e)
What is the section labeled?
Raspuns:TCP
Are these communications considered to be reliable?
Raspuns:Da
Record the SRC PORT, DEST PORT, SEQUENCE NUM, and ACK NUM values.
SRC PORT = 1027
DEST PORT = 80
SEQUENCE NUM = 1
ACK NUM = 1

Step 1.f)
Which TCP flags are set in this PDU?
Raspuns: ACK si PSH

Step 1. h)
How are the port and sequence numbers different than before?
Raspuns: sunt inversate

Step 1. i)
What information is now listed in the TCP section? How are the port and sequence numbers different from the previous two PDUs?
Raspuns:sursa si destinatia sunt inversate, ACK NUM este 103

Step 2.c)
Are these communications considered to be reliable?
Raspuns: da

Step 2.d)
Record the SRC PORT, DEST PORT, SEQUENCE NUM, and ACK NUM values.
Raspuns:
SRC PORT = 1027
DEST PORT = 21
SEQUENCE NUM = 0
ACK NUM = 0
What is the value in the flag field?
Raspuns: SYN

Step 2.f)
How are the port and sequence numbers different than before?
Raspuns: sunt inversate

Step 2.g)
How are the port and sequence numbers different from the previous results?
Raspuns: porturile sunt la fel, dar SEQ NUM SI ACK NUM sunt ambele 1

Step 2.i)
What is the message from the server?
Raspuns: Welcome to PT Ftp server

Step 3.d)
What is the Layer 4 protocol?
Raspuns: UDP
Are these communications considered to be reliable?
Raspuns: nu

Step 3.e)
SRC PORT = 1026
DEST PORT = 53
Why are there no sequence and acknowledgement numbers?
Raspuns: UDP nu trebuie sa seteze o comunicare reliable


Step 3.g)
How are the port and sequence numbers different than before?
Raspuns: sunt inversate port sursa cu port destinatie
What is the last section of the PDU called? What is the IP address for the name multiserver.pt.ptu?
Raspuns: DNS Answer, adresa ip pentru multiserver.pt.ptu este 192.168.1.254

Step 4.d)
What transport layer protocol does email traffic use?
Raspuns: Layer 4, TCP
Are these communications considered to be reliable?
Raspuns:da

Step 4.e)
SRC PORT = 1026
DEST PORT = 25
SEQUENCE NUM = 0
ACK NUM = 0
FLAG = SYN

Step 4.g)
How are the port and sequence numbers different than before?
Raspuns: sunt inversate intre ele

Step 4.h)
How are the port and sequence numbers different from the previous two results?
Raspuns: sunt iar inversate

Step 4.i)
How are the port and sequence numbers different from the previous two PDUs?
Raspuns: inversate
What email protocol is associated with TCP port 25? What protocol is associated with TCP port 110?
Raspuns: nu stiu
