Differences are also found in the evoked potential as a function of whether or not the sensory modality of the stimulus was anticipated correctly. The major waveform alteration is in the amplitude of a positive-going component which reaches peak amplitude at about 300 milliseconds.}}

Since P300 wave is a cognitive response across multiple brain channels correlated between the measured electroencephalogram (EEG) and deviant stimulus in a specific period, it requires a suitable signal processing application for interpretation. Moreover, multiple steps of data processing under neuroscience criteria make the P300 reflection difficult to analyze by common methods. Therefore, this study proposes the processing model for brainwave applications based on P300 peak signal detection in multiple brain channels. This study applies 64 channels ERP datasets throughout bandpass filter in fast Fourier transform (FFT) with the specific ranges of signal processing while ERP averaging is applied as a feature extraction method. Furthermore, the experimental metadata is applied with the filtered P300 peak signals in channel classification via a machine learning method, the Decision Tree. The experimental results indicate the accurate mental reflection of P300 evoked potential in different brain channels with high classification accuracy relying on the contrast condition throughout the original data source averaged across the individual electrodes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={8}, journal={Journal of Web Engineering}, author={Srimaharaj, Wanus and Chaisricharoen, Roungsan}, year={2021}, month={Nov.}, pages={2545–2570} }

abstract = {The next generation of AI applications will continuously interact with the environment and learn from these interactions. These applications impose new and demanding systems requirements, both in terms of performance and flexibility. In this paper, we consider these requirements and present Ray--a distributed system to address them. Ray implements a unified interface that can express both task-parallel and actor-based computations, supported by a single dynamic execution engine. To meet the performance requirements, Ray employs a distributed scheduler and a distributed and fault-tolerant store to manage the system's control state. In our experiments, we demonstrate scaling beyond 1.8 million tasks per second and better performance than existing specialized systems for several challenging reinforcement learning applications.},
